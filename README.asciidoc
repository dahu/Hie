`:HieIdx`
~~~~~~~~~

Use the `:HieIdx` command to initialise a Hie directory.

TIP: It's best to do this in an empty directory.

[NOTE]
====
This will do two things in the current directory:

. Create a `data` directory.
. Create a `hie.idx` file.
====

Usage
~~~~~

Press `ctrl-]` on words or visually highlighted text to create new
notes indexed as such.

Press `ctrl-t` to jump back to prior notes.

Use `:Hie someterm` to create a note from the command line.

The `hie.idx` file is the master index of terms.
